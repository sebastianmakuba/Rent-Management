# **House Manager**
## Description of the Project
The challenge of untrustworthy caretakers has been a key issue for property owners especially in developing countries. THis is acknowledged to the opaque nature of how most transactions are handled. 
House manager looks to solve this issue by having an intregral and open system where both the owner and the manager have access to the properties details. It also aims to reduce the cases of fraud and theft by ascertaining authenticity and transparency. This is achieved by allowing the user have access to the payment details which are recorded for future references. Moreover, they have a summary of any transactions that might have occured along the months.
## Explanation of the Project
The project employs the use of CSS, HTML and JS to function effectively. In the JS, the primary goal is making transacions and recording them in the server for future reference. Since the main goal is transparence, the system has been made in such a way that there are different tenants and owners sections. 

### Tenant Section
This is a simple section that shows the tenants invoices. It does so by capturing the previous payments as well as bills uploaded by the owner. Additionally, it allows the tenant to pay their rent and apploads the payment in the system. It is simple yet exhaustive. to log into the system, the password for tenants is their id no and username is the house number. 

### Owner Section
This is where most thisngs happen. The owners have the power to add or remove tenants. Through this new tenants are easily added to the system. This is enabled through a system that records the input and uploads it to a server for easy access. Additionally the owner can remove the user from the system by entering their id and clicking a button. Another feature is the add bills button. Through this, the owner can update the user their pending bills which is adds up to the net rent. 

## Set Up instructions
The project has a login page that opens either a tenant or owner section. To navigate to the tenant's sections, ypu use the house number as your username and the the ID no as ypur password. These choices were made since both of these attributes are unique.
